# CE_ABM
Contains the model files for the publication "Selection-driven tumor evolution involving non-cell growth promotion leads to patterns of clonal expansion consistent with neutrality interpretation"

V2.6.0.py --- This is the main model file, and is the code that produced all of the data in the publication. 

Single_file.py --- This is a file used to condense model output files from different simulations into a single file for easier plotting.
muller_converter --- This is the file for converting the output clonal architecture into long format for EvoFreq or other uses. EvoFreq can be found at https://github.com/MathOnco/EvoFreq

VAF_converter --- This is the file used to extract the VAFs from the output clonal architecture.

IVAF_converter --- This is the file used to calculate the inverse VAFs and the cumulative mutation distribution. 

The model files are still being uploaded and edited, this page is a placeholder for the manuscript. If you are reading this text, note that the repository is incomplete and will be completed before the publication of the aforementioned paper.
